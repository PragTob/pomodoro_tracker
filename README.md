## Under construction [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/PragTob/pomodoro_tracker.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/PragTob/pomodoro_tracker) [![Code Climate](https://codeclimate.com/github/PragTob/pomodoro_tracker.png)](https://codeclimate.com/github/PragTob/pomodoro_tracker)

This pomodoro tracker is still under construction. I use it to manage my day-to todos though so it's safe to try for the adventurous I'd say. :-)

So why this thing? It should work on every PC where shoes runs. You can create todo items with an estimation of the pomodori it will take to complete them. And then you can work on them. You will get the usual 25minutes work/5 minute break. Signaled with a clock ticking down and when it's over an alarm clock sound.

Right now everything is saved into YAML files. You may configure the path to that YAML file so that you can put it in your Dropbox (for instance) for easy syncinc across all your devices.

This is intentionally not a website/Internet service. I truly love the web, but not everything needs to be online. That just means having another login, server, Internet connection etc... some things can be local and work wonderfully.
